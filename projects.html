                    This project is a "cheat sheet" for web development. HTML elements and values that commonly work with each of them, along with some tips and tricks are included. CSS selectors and acceptable values with explanations are also shown.

                    Sandbox is a long term project idea that will allow me to code from my web browser and more easily store my new ideas that are going well to this page.

                    My Journal is an idea I had while serving in the Sunday School Presidency of the Cleveland Ward in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I've been trying to keep a personal journal for a few years now using Google Docs. While Docs works just fine, I wanted to try and detatch myself from one of if not the largest tech companies in the world. <br><br>The plan is eventually to have an app that lets a user record journal entries and store them in a password protected journal that can be stored either locally or on this website. Once the app meets my personal needs, I'll start working on making the UX more modular and customizable by letting users select from a list of fonts, font sizes and weights, and even colors. Now that I'm typing this, I'm remembering things like Yahoo Messenger and how customizable they were; I want this app to be at least that customizable while being even more secure.
