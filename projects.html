                    This project is a "cheat sheet" for web development. HTML elements and values that commonly work with each of them, along with some tips and tricks are included. CSS selectors and acceptable values with explanations are also shown.

                    Sandbox is a long term project idea that will allow me to code from my web browser and more easily store my new ideas that are going well to this page.

                    My Journal is an idea I had while serving in the Sunday School Presidency of the Cleveland Ward in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I've been trying to keep a personal journal for a few years now using Google Docs. While Docs works just fine, I wanted to try and detatch myself from one of if not the largest tech companies in the world. <br><br>The plan is eventually to have an app that lets a user record journal entries and store them in a password protected journal that can be stored either locally or on this website. Once the app meets my personal needs, I'll start working on making the UX more modular and customizable by letting users select from a list of fonts, font sizes and weights, and even colors. Now that I'm typing this, I'm remembering things like Yahoo Messenger and how customizable they were; I want this app to be at least that customizable while being even more secure.

                    "Noted" is an idea I have for a note-taking app (and/or a web applet). I'd like it to be cross-platform and able to be used with a stylus if a user has one. Also would like to add a way to write well with just the user's finger; what I'm thinking is click on the line (for a ruled page) and it'll zoom in allowing you to write the word and necessary punctuation you are on, and then based on user-preference either auto-clear or clear on button push/gesture to make room for the next word/punctuation. While the user is writing and the program is keeping their interface clear for them, the program will also place each word on the line where the user selected, keeping things neat and easy-to-read.

                    This isn't exactly a program idea as much as it is an idea I had to make some money. I have a reference material playlist and a lot of different content on it. If I were to organize that into categories and mark each video with appropriate credit to the original author, I could make shorts of other people's long-form content and host it on a channel dedicated to a particular topic, then start publishing that content. It wouldn't make very much money at first, but the more channels and platforms I do this on the more I can multiply my revenue streams. <br><br>Try this with one category of content first; wait and see how that goes and decide if it's worth further effort. Probably good to get a list of about 51 shorts premade and then roll out 1 per day mon-sat for a month or so and then see if the channel grows at all. I'll start out on YouTube and Rumble, and if either of those look promising I'll pay for an X Premium account and roll out content there in the same fashion, with relevant memes along the way.
