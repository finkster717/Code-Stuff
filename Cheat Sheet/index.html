        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <p>As you may have guessed from the title, this site is a cheat sheat for anything that I, Finkster, would like to have a note of or be able to copy and paste in the future. Each navigation link above will lead to a cheat sheat related to the respective topic. Because there are such a wide variety of programming languages, scripting languages, and markup languages, different pages are needed for each topic and they may need to be styled differently to reflect that. But don't worry, I tried to keep any inconsistencies to a minimum!</p>
