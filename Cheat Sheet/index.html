        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <p>As you may have guessed from the title, this site is a cheat sheat for anything that I, Finkster, would like to have a note of or be able to copy and paste in the future. Each navigation link above will lead to a cheat sheat related to the respective topic. Because there are such a wide variety of programming languages, scripting languages, and markup languages, different pages are needed for each topic and they may need to be styled differently to reflect that. But don't worry, I tried to keep any inconsistencies to a minimum!</p>

        <div id="todo-container">
            <h1>To-Do List</h1>
            <ul id="todo-list">
                <li>Add more elements to HTML elements table</li>
                <li>My beautiful sweet wife had a great idea to have random Gospel-related quotes appear in the footer</li>
                <li>Add a section to CSS page that elaborates further on complex CSS properties. Make sure to mention variants of each property as needed, such as "margin" and "margin-bottom."</li>
                <li>Define and expound on the flex and block display properties specifically somewhere on the CSS page.</li>
                <li>For each selector, property, or attribute that is referenced in a table and is further expanded upon in another section, turn it into a link so the user can skip down to where a more elaborate explanation is given.</li>
                <li>Some pages are getting too long... Make all of the sections collapsible, create links for each section on the left margin of each page, and add a button/link that collapses all of the sections and scrolls with the user.</li>
            </ul>
